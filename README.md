## porn.host.srv
This zone is served by [SpamHausTech.com][1], but as it contains tremendous
numbers of [false-positives][2], we have decided to setup of an PyFunceble
test environment to prove why it is important to maintain a zone file

A first up eye-catcher is the usage of `*.userName.tumblr.com`
as there are no such thing on thumblr....

Another example is `britneyspears.ac` which does **NOT** contain any
adult(Pornographic) material at all

As we can read from our [powerDNS recursor](https://www.powerdns.com/recursor.html)'s
log, this is a incredible big zone

```bash
pdns_recursor: Loaded & indexed 4406096 policy records so far for RPZ zone 'porn.host.srv'
```

To see the number of FP's you should keep a eye on this file
<https://github.com/dns-test/porn.host.rpz/blob/master/output/logs/percentage/percentage.txt>

### DNS zones
If you are so lucky that you have updated your system to use a DNS resolver
rather than abusing your disk-IO with the `hosts` file, we generate a
zone regular RPZ supported DNS resolvers.

*Note*: If you'll read more about why you should switch to a local DNS resolver,
Please read this [Performance Test of Hosts File vs. Dns-recursors][3]

### RPZ
You'll find the RPZ formatted files at [My Privacy DNS](https://www.mypdns.org/w/rpz/)

The syntax used for is to provide a `NXDOMAIN` response

Ex.

```python
youseeporn.com		CNAME	.
*.youseeporn.com	CNAME	.
```
